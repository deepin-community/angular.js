Description: lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser
 It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends) as your template
 language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's
 components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from
 your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data
 binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to
 test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and
 inversion of control. It also helps with server-side communication, taming
 async callbacks with promises and deferreds; and make client-side navigation
 and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of cake.
